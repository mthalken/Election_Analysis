## Election Audit Summary
To the election commission:
This coding can be applied to all future elections as long as the csv. is consistant. One option to get ahead of this would be to code the option in to allow the code find and organize the columns if data is shown in a different format in the csv. This code could also be used for the whole state, all counties, and all local elections. We could always add a timer to give the time it took to process all of the data.
